# Development challenge

This project aims to enrich the studies of professionals working in web, mobile, and back-end development by offering a series of practical challenges.

For **Front-End Web** and **Mobile** developers, we provide [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Q44nlEVrODE7W6iBFRVPZL/Desafio-para-devs---App-%2F-Dashboard-%7C-UX%2FUI?type=design&node-id=1%3A4&mode=design&t=1oLA9vtlXknWRtig-1) with screen flows, components, and a ready-to-use style guide to streamline the construction process and provide a development experience closer to reality. 
Additionally, the project includes an **API** ready for use, configured to run in a Docker environment or online, published by us. This API includes routes for listings, authentication, user creation, login, among other functionalities, allowing developers to focus primarily on design and interface implementation.

For **back-end** developers, the challenge is to replicate the already developed routes in their preferred programming language and then produce relevant documentation.

### This **README** is currently divided into two parts:

In Instructions for challengers you will find instructions for completing the challenge by creating an interface, whether web or mobile, for the routes existing in the project documentation and also challenges for creating the same routes using your preferred programming language.
- [Instructions and challenges](readme_files/challenged.md)

In Instructions for contributors you will find instructions to contribute to the project, whether to correct bugs or add new features.
