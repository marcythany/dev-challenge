# Development challenge

This project was designed to strengthen the studies of professionals working in web, mobile, and back-end development, offering a range of practical challenges.

For front-end developers, we provide a ready-to-use API set up to run in a Docker environment. This API includes routes for listings, authentication, user creation, login, among other features. This allows the developer to focus primarily on the design and implementation of interfaces.

The challenge set for back-end developers is to replicate the already developed routes in their preferred programming language and then produce relevant documentation.


### This **README** is currently divided into two parts:

In Instructions for challengers you will find instructions for completing the challenge by creating an interface, whether web or mobile, for the routes existing in the project documentation and also challenges for creating the same routes using your preferred programming language.
- [Instructions and challanges](readme_files/challenged.md)

In Instructions for contributors you will find instructions to contribute to the project, whether to correct bugs or add new features.
